1
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:27,723
We live and die in the shadows,

2
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,030
for those we hold close

3
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:32,467
and for those we never meet.

4
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,775
The end you always
feared is coming.

5
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,864
The Anti-God.

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,084
This "entity" has
multiple personalities.

7
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,177
You're telling me this
thing has a mind of its own?

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,958
A self-aware, self-learning,
truth-eating digital parasite

9
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,135
infesting all of cyberspace.

10
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,963
An enemy that is everywhere
and nowhere and has no center.

11
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:53,009
Patiently listening,
reading, watching.

12
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,881
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

13
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,668
Able to beguile, blackmail,
bribe or be anyone it wants.

14
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,974
Ethan, that is not me!
You're talking to the Entity.

15
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,977
Whoever controls the
Entity controls the truth.

16
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,719
...most secure data centers
are breached and corrupted.

17
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:09,286
The Entity will know precisely

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,896
how to undermine
our every strength.

19
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,507
Turn our allies into enemies...

20
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,248
And exploit our every weakness.

21
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:16,815
...and our enemies
into aggressors.

22
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:20,214
An unstoppable force of destructive power
that would just lay waste to everything.

23
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:24,214
The world is changing.
Truth is vanishing.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,303
War is coming.

25
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,723
Good evening, Ethan.

26
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:56,290
This is your president.

27
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,293
Since you won't
reply to anyone else,

28
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,338
I thought I'd
reach out directly.

29
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,080
First, I want to thank you

30
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,779
for a lifetime of devoted
and unrelenting service.

31
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:15,483
Were it not for the tireless
dedication of you and your team,

32
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,660
the Earth would be a
very different place.

33
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,142
It might not even
be here at all.

34
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:25,971
Every risk you've taken...

35
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,280
every comrade you've
lost in the field...

36
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:39,071
every personal
sacrifice you made...

37
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:43,946
has brought this
world another sunrise.

38
00:02:46,383 --> 00:02:50,735
It's been 35 years since
circumstances brought you to us

39
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,608
and you were given the choice,

40
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,524
since the IMF saved you

41
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,439
from a life in prison.

42
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,921
And though you never
followed orders,

43
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,837
you never let us down.

44
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,640
You were always
the best of men...

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,600
in the worst of times.

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,480
I need you to be that man now.

47
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,135
In the months since you
evaded capture in Austria,

48
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,227
every corner of cyberspace has
been infested by the truth-eating,

49
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,926
parasitic A.I. known
to us as the Entity.

50
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,493
Under its influence,

51
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:55,713
digital information has
been corrupted worldwide.

52
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,934
Nations and people no
longer know what to believe.

53
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,544
Antagonism,

54
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:03,895
aggression and martial law
are the new world order.

55
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,158
Exploiting this
paranoid atmosphere,

56
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,900
the Entity has inspired
a doomsday cult

57
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,860
with acolytes devoted to
ridding the world of corruption

58
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,949
through human extinction.

59
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,603
And He said unto
Noah, "Behold..."

60
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:16,999
"I will bring a
flood upon the earth

61
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,736
to destroy all flesh."

62
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,956
The children of the atom
shall rise from the ashes.

63
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,350
And the Entity will
help them rebuild.

64
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:27,658
These fanatics are secretly infiltrating
every level of law enforcement,

65
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,095
government and our military,

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,316
devoted to serving their
digital master's ultimate goal.

67
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,928
Our only hope of
controlling the Entity

68
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:40,149
relies on finding its
original source code.

69
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:44,284
If anyone knows the whereabouts
of this code, it's this man.

70
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,679
His identity, his past, his
very existence have been erased,

71
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:53,684
suggesting he is or was
in league with the Entity.

72
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:57,297
Austrian authorities have
his accomplice in custody.

73
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,212
But she has refused
to tell us anything.

74
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,477
Which brings us back to you.

75
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:07,785
You are in possession of a key
believed to be a vital component

76
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,832
in our struggle to acquire
the Entity's source code.

77
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,051
Yet you refuse to come in,

78
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,446
fearing any government will
weaponize this malicious A.I.

79
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,753
against the rest of the world.

80
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,190
Instead you've resolved
to kill the Entity,

81
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:25,542
a reckless act that would trigger
the total annihilation of cyberspace.

82
00:05:25,716 --> 00:05:28,023
This would eradicate
the global economy,

83
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:32,288
plunging the world into
war and famine without end.

84
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,726
Agent Hunt. Ethan.

85
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,033
Please surrender.

86
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,645
Or the blood of the world
will be on your hands.

87
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,084
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

88
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,260
Come home, Ethan,

89
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,351
and bring us that key.

90
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:05,408
End it now! End it now!

91
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:08,672
End it now! End it
now! End it now!

92
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,990
End it now! End it
now! End it now!

93
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:26,750
Hey, Ethan.

94
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:29,318
Hey, Luther.

95
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:32,103
Sorry about the decor.
The Ritz was booked solid.

96
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:35,063
Well, some drapes, a few
throw pillows, and...

97
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,499
Yeah, a minibar.

98
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:40,851
Foosball table.

99
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,817
Hey, bro. Hey.

100
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:57,781
It's always good to see you on
the right side of the grass.

101
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,481
I'm worried you're
working too hard.

102
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,266
Don't worry about ol' Luther.

103
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,963
Okay.

104
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,705
So, what did you
manage to find out?

105
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,229
A lot.

106
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,537
More than I bargained for.

107
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,019
So, what's the play?

108
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,193
First,

109
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,283
we have to find Gabriel.

110
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:23,415
How do we find him?

111
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,865
You will betray us

112
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,476
because he spared your life.

113
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,444
STOP. STOP.

114
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,403
Wait, wait, wait!

115
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,365
Why...

116
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,976
did you spare my life?

117
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,200
Wait, wait, wait!

118
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:54,814
You call that in, it's the end
of the world... simple as that.

119
00:09:54,898 --> 00:09:55,899
Degas, isn't it?

120
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,945
Clock is running.

121
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,517
You take us in, there won't be
anyone on Earth who can stop it.

122
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,080
There's a part of
you that knows that.

123
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,253
I can see it.

124
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,523
For God's sake, just
trust him! Wait, wait, no!

125
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,129
It's okay, it's okay!

126
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,610
Degas, it's okay. There's
no nations on this one.

127
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,655
There's no rival
ideologies, no dogma.

128
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:16,137
It's who keeps their
head and who panics.

129
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:19,227
The Entity wants you scared,
it wants us all scared.

130
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,098
It wants us divided.

131
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,579
It wants you to turn us in.

132
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,625
Don't do it.

133
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,761
He's gonna be okay.

134
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,371
Please, Degas.

135
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,766
Please.

136
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,406
We're friends.

137
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,810
Gabriel...

138
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,856
Where is he?

139
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,995
You shouldn't be in
there without backup.

140
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,084
Benji, please. We got this.

141
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,608
This is a terrible
idea. Just relax.

142
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,919
Ethan, this place is crawling
with clandestine services.

143
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,308
You should get out of there.

144
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,963
I see them. It's okay.
Stay calm, Benji.

145
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,356
I don't think Gabriel would
risk coming to that party.

146
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,967
Abort.

147
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:50,318
No, let's just hold
our nerve. He's here.

148
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,233
He's got to be here.

149
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,447
Ethan, for God's sake,
abort! We'll figure this out.

150
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,759
Not a problem yet.

151
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,548
Stay where you are.

152
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,682
Don't move, Hunt.

153
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,470
Are you sure it's really me?

154
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,173
All units, we have Hunt.
I repeat, we have Hunt.

155
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,783
They can't hear you.

156
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,051
Grace.

157
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:42,022
I didn't even see
you get that one.

158
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,546
What separates a good
pickpocket from a great one?

159
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,548
Timing.

160
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,245
Gentlemen?

161
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,992
Nice and slow.

162
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,266
Nothing personal.

163
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,360
You know, I like
the longer hair.

164
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:19,668
I really appreciate your coming,
but you shouldn't be here.

165
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,365
I didn't have much choice.

166
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,628
Will you expect
me to betray him?

167
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,849
I expect you to save
him from himself

168
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,199
and the world from him.

169
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,549
Kittridge.

170
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:36,467
You just bought yourself
a world of trouble, Grace.

171
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,600
The whole world's
in trouble, Ethan.

172
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,385
You're the only one
I trust to save it.

173
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,085
So, what's the play?

174
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:52,527
Grace!

175
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,400
Grace.

176
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,753
Gabriel's got a
job for you, Hunt.

177
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:06,757
Ethan, wake up!

178
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:12,329
Okay, what do we do?

179
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,550
Tell me you have a plan.

180
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,599
They took my watch.

181
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,515
Your watch? Yeah,
and my cuff links.

182
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,735
Had lock picks in them. I see.

183
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,085
We'll find a way out,
okay? Now, listen.

184
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,743
Ah, it's too late.

185
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,963
It's coming.

186
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,704
Okay, Grace, look at me.

187
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,576
You're gonna get through this.

188
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,319
Get through what?

189
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,625
Just keep telling yourself...

190
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,366
it's only pain.

191
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,288
Stop! Don't touch him!

192
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,858
You can't hurt him.

193
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,950
Not that way.

194
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,127
Take you back to Shanghai?

195
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,086
What was her name?

196
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,566
Julia!

197
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,742
The former Mrs. Hunt.

198
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,701
Did Ethan fail to mention her?

199
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,878
A fellow named
Davian took her...

200
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,229
and ransomed her for something

201
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:29,754
only Ethan could get.

202
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,409
Davian called it
the Rabbit's Foot.

203
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,976
But it had another name.

204
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,066
The Anti-God.

205
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,113
They never told you what was
in that canister, did they?

206
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,245
But you always wondered.

207
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,596
Stealing the Rabbit's
Foot was just one event

208
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:50,297
in a lifelong pattern,
repeating itself over and over.

209
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:54,779
For every life he's tried to
save, he's gambled millions more,

210
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,868
doubling down and down again.

211
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:01,090
And now the fate of every
living soul on Earth is

212
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:03,614
his responsibility.

213
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,617
You must be exhausted.

214
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,054
Where's the key?

215
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,056
Let her go.

216
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,710
Then we'll discuss it.
We don't have the time.

217
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:15,975
Someone you hold
close will die tonight

218
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,847
for the sake of those
you will never meet,

219
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,632
unless you do exactly as I say.

220
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,418
He also said the key would be
his on the train, remember?

221
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,725
You had one job:

222
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,078
Get on the train, get the
key, get off the train.

223
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:36,430
How did your master take the news
when it found out you blew it?

224
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,040
You failed,

225
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,912
and now the Entity
has forsaken you.

226
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,220
Your team's been
compromised, Ethan.

227
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:48,181
I know what Luther's doing.
I know what you're planning.

228
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,661
Resist me and I'll
make you pay dearly.

229
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,228
If you cooperate,

230
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,100
I can help.

231
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,276
In exchange for what?

232
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,714
You're searching for a Russian
submarine vanished on its maiden voyage.

233
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,412
The K559 Sevastopol.

234
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:06,373
A state-of-the-art submarine completely
undetectable to any known sonar.

235
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:09,637
And the secret to its
invisibility was that.

236
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,160
The Podkova.

237
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,206
A counter-acoustic
algorithmic drive

238
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,035
located in theSevastopol's
sonar sphere.

239
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,385
Now, in the winter of 2012

240
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,996
the Russians discovered a
computer virus of unknown origin

241
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,911
spreading through
their Black Sea fleet.

242
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,740
A digital covert operative.

243
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:28,090
We suspect this mystery
virus was only intended

244
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:31,876
to sabotage the Podkova, rendering
the submarine detectable.

245
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,791
Instead... It tricked the crew

246
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,706
into sinking themselves.

247
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,926
Captain! Our own torpedo
is not responding.

248
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,362
It's coming right at us!

249
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,364
Our torpedo's homing!
Range 400 meters!

250
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,800
Sound the collision alar...

251
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:48,371
If we're right, the one thing
we need to kill the Entity,

252
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,069
its original source code,

253
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:53,594
is buried in theSevastopol's
sonar sphere.

254
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,467
Somewhere deep at the bottom
of the ocean, frozen in time,

255
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,296
where even the Entity
can't reach it.

256
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,561
Now, the Podkova's housing was designed
to self-destruct if tampered with.

257
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,476
The only way to
safely open it...

258
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,133
is with a specially
designed cruciform key.

259
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:15,833
The two halves of which were held
by the Sevastopol's captain and XO.

260
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,227
They were pulled from
the drifting pack ice

261
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:20,403
in the spring of 2012

262
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,624
by Inuit fishermen.

263
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,582
A man of your skills

264
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:31,414
now has all he needs to pinpoint
that sub down to the square yard.

265
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,504
You think I'm gonna get the
source code and bring it to you.

266
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,724
I don't think. I know.

267
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,466
I'm gonna let you go.

268
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,251
Then you're gonna find the Entity's
source code and bring it to me

269
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:44,514
in exchange for Grace.

270
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,908
Then I'll take
control of the Entity,

271
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:51,260
the proverbial
genie you let out.

272
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:53,262
The Rabbit's Foot.

273
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,046
The Anti-God.

274
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:56,961
It wasn't a biological
or a chemical weapon

275
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,876
you took from Shanghai.

276
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,619
The vial you traded for Julia
contained malicious code.

277
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,405
The primordial digital ooze

278
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:08,016
from which a weapon evolved.

279
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,584
A weapon the East
couldn't make work.

280
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:13,804
A weapon the West might
never have made on their own.

281
00:19:13,978 --> 00:19:15,498
You didn't know what
you were stealing.

282
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,286
None of us did.

283
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,288
I knew why I was stealing it.

284
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,204
They kidnapped my wife.

285
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,938
Stealing the Rabbit's Foot was
the only way I could get her back.

286
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,950
I sank that submarine as
much as the Entity did.

287
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,518
Without you, Ethan,

288
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,998
there'd be no Entity.

289
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,480
And if you don't find that
sub in the next few days...

290
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:41,005
It'
